## solutions
1. `caseChanger`
2. `arrayGenerator`
3. `primeNumbersFinder`

# caseChanger
Write a function that accepts a string as input and swaps the case of each character.

## instructions
Prompt a user input for the console and create a variable for the prompt function.
Create a function `caseChanger` that changes the case of every letter of the text provided by the user.
Call the function and use the variable containing the prompt as it`s argument.
The case of every letter will then be changed.


# arrayGenerator
Write a function that accepts two numbers to generate an array between them.

## instructions
Prompt a user input for the console.
Create two prompt functions to hold the starting and the endimg number.
Then create a function `arrayGenerator` (with two parameters and an empty array to hold the generated numbers) that will generate numbers between the starting and the ending numbers provided by the user.
Call the function and use the variables containing the prompt functions as it`s arguments.
An array of numbers between the provided numbers will be generated. 


# primeNumbersFinder
Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers from the original array. 

## instructions
Prompt a user input for the console and create a variable for the prompt function.
Split the array string provided by the input into substrings and convert it to an array of numbers.
Create a function `isPrime` that will determine if a number is a prime number.
Filter the array provided and use `isPrime` function as it`s callback inorder to execute the function in the array provided.
Store the filter process in a variable inorder to store the filtered values in the variable.
The variable will then have an array of prime numbers when logged in the console.
